    <h2>Abstract</h2>
    <p>
      GORE, or better said "Better Goods Web Recommender", is a website used enlarge your current library of possible
      goods to consume, being capable of using the user's <code>preferences</code> and those of his friends to
      recommend future
      possible ingredients or food stuffs.
    </p>

  <section typeof="sa:Introduction" id="introduction" role="doc-introduction">
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      Gore, while seeming simple or even useless, can be a saviour in case you are at your wits ends while choosing
      what to eat, you got bored of your current product choices or your mother asked you what you want to eat and
      doesn't want you to be unimaginative.
    </p>
    <p>
      Just add to the filters what kind of product you wish to see and do not
      wish to see, or even scan products to add them as your favorite to make the search more efficient, and you may
      discover products you weren't aware of or even might get in the mood to eat something you haven't in a long time!
    </p>

  <section typeof="sa:Development" id="development" role="doc-development">
    <h2>Development</h2>
    <p>
      No project has ever been created without any kind of planning. As such, we too went through a planning process to
      create the Gore app.
    </p>
    <section id="The general view">
      <h2>The general view</h2>
      <p>
        As we couldn't know from the beginning how our app will work, not perfectly at least, it was needed a general
        view on what the use can do. As such, we created a number of AML schemas to display our view on the user
        possibilities and the general arhitecture of the api needed for such app.
      </p>
      <p>
        <img src="./imgs/general1.png" />
      </p>
    </section>
    <section id="The particular view">
      <h2>The particular view</h2>
      <p>
        Of course, a general view can not show our intentions with the app to a third party, or to ourselves in case we
        need to step back someday and remind ourselves what we wanted to do with Gore and to keep it simpe. As such, a
        particular view on each possibility of the user was needed, this "particular view" being each use case. The use
        cases in our ... case were the login, the product addition to the favorites list, the bar code scan and the
        receival of recommandations.
      </p>
      <p>
        <img src="./imgs/general2.png" />
      </p>
      <p>
        Now, this schema is a bit too general to be called a particular view on the workings of the page, but it is needed to see what is needed for each action of the user. For a more particular view, the next picture shows it best.

    <section id="The packages">
      <h2>The packages</h2>
      <p>
        Nothing works just because we want it to, as such there is a need for classes and methods to make the app work as desired. For ease of understanding, we separated the packages in 3 categories: Data package (for the back end part of the app), user interact package (as the name says, the packages with which the user interacts), and the external communication package (because our api doesn't have all the information needed, requiring login from facebook and information of products from an external api), and a persister package (to keep the data from disappearing after a refresh).
      </p>
      <p>
        <img src="./imgs/packages.png" />
      </p>
    </section>
    <section id="The server">
      <h2>The server</h2>
      <p>
        Or api, respects the restful principles , i.e it exposes the information required by the client at a call, each call having a different URI. The server knows what information it must returns from the headers sent together with the call itself.
      </p>
      <p>
        <img src="./imgs/api.png" />
      </p>
    </section>
    <section id="The database">
      <h2>The database</h2>
      <p>
        While the api interprets the calls form the client, the information it gets doesnt come from nowhere, but from a specific database. The database will hold information referring to each user, from username and password(after being crypted), to the user's preferences.

    </section><section id="Preview">
      <h3>The <code>preview</code></h3>
      <p>Being the first page that the user use, this page gives a short explanation on what it can do, both in a
        paragraph and in a row with boxes.</p>
    </section>
    <section id="Scan">
      <h3>The <code>scan</code></h3>
      <p>
        We separated the scanning from the recommandations list to ease the add and removal of favorite products for
        the user, making it a list of its own.
      </p>
      <p>

    </section>
    <section id="Recommandations">
      <h3>The <code>recommandations</code></h3>
      <p>
        Giving filters for the user to use, the page will show recommended items based on said filter and the already
        preferred products of the user.

    </section>
    <section id="Login">
      <h3>The <code>login</code></h3>
      <p>
        To ease the friend based products filter, to help the user filter and see the goods <code>prefered</code> by
        your friends, a
        facebook login was implemented.

    </section>
    <section id="Statistics">
      <h3>The <code>statistics</code></h3>
      <p>
        Gore app gives the user the possibility to see the statistics for the general userbase of the app, as the user himself and his friends.

  <section typeof="sa:Technologies" id="technologies" role="doc-technologies">
    <h2>Technologies</h2>
    <p>To create the page, a set of technologies were of course used, and being only the client-side being created, the
      list narrows down to:
      <ul>
        <li>HTML-CSS: The basics and essentials for a webpage.</li>
        <li>Javascript: To create an interactive page and easier to use filters, javascript is ideal.</li>
        <li>SCSS: Indeed, CSS is the basic, but sometime it can be rather repetitive or just tiresome, so we took
          advantage of a CSS-compiler to ease our work.</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
  </section>
  <section typeof="sa:HowToUse" id="howToUse" role="doc-howToUse">
    <h2>How to use</h2>
    <p>Gore is an easy to use website for products recommandations.</p>
    <section id="Login">
      <h2>Login</h2>
      <p>
        The possibility to login is present in all pages, being in the menu from the index and the header from the
        other 2 pages. A simple click and facebook based login and it is done.
      </p>
    </section>
    <section id="Scan">
      <h2>Scan</h2>
      <p>
        Scanning products in the scan page is really easy, clicking on the "Scan new product" button, and positioning
        the bar code in from of the laptop's webcam or phone' camera and making the photo.
      </p>
      <p>On the same page, it is possible to add the scanned products to the favorite lists, and to remove them from
        said list, all with the help of the "Add to/Remove from favorites"</p>
    </section>
    <section id="Recommandations">
      <h2>Recommandations</h2>
      <p>Such recommandations will appear as soon as one enters the recommandations page, and the list will update from
        every filter change.</p>

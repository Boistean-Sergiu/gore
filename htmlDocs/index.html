    <h2>Abstract</h2>
    <p>
      GORE, or better said "Better Goods Web Recommender", is a website used enlarge your current library of possible
      goods to consume, being capable of using the user's <code>preferences</code> and those of his friends to
      recommend future
      possible ingredients or food stuffs.
    </p>
  </section>
  <section typeof="sa:Introduction" id="introduction" role="doc-introduction">
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      Gore, while seeming simple or even useless, can be a saviour in case you are at your wits ends while choosing
      what to eat, you got bored of your current product choices or your mother asked you what you want to eat and
      doesn't want you to be unimaginative.
    </p>
    <p>
      Just add to the filters what kind of product you wish to see and do not
      wish to see, or even scan products to add them as your favorite to make the search more efficient, and you may
      discover products you weren't aware of or even might get in the mood to eat something you haven't in a long time!
    </p>
  </section>
  <section typeof="sa:Structure" id="structure" role="doc-structure">
    <h2>Structure</h2>
    <p>
      To not be crude and enter directly in a page with tons of filters and other complicated or visually ugly or messy
      sections, we separated in 3 pages the website, one in which is explained in short what GORE is capable of, one to
      scan and add favorite products and one giving the recommandations.
    </p>
    <section id="Preview">
      <h3>The <code>preview</code></h3>
      <p>Being the first page that the user use, this page gives a short explanation on what it can do, both in a
        paragraph and in a row with boxes.</p>
    </section>
    <section id="Scan">
      <h3>The <code>scan</code></h3>
      <p>
        We separated the scanning from the recommandations list to ease the add and removal of favorite products for
        the user, making it a list of its own.
      </p>
    </section>
    <section id="Recommandations">
      <h3>The <code>recommandations</code></h3>
      <p>
        Giving filters for the user to use, the page will show recommended items based on said filter and the already
        preferred products of the user.
      </p>
    </section>
    <section id="Login">
      <h3>The <code>login</code></h3>
      <p>
        To ease the friend based products filter, to help the user filter and see the goods <code>prefered</code> by
        your friends, a
        facebook.
    </section>
  </section>
  <section typeof="sa:Technologies" id="technologies" role="doc-technologies">
    <h2>Technologies</h2>
    <p>To create the page, a set of technologies were of course used, and being only the client-side being created, the
      list narrows down to:
      <ul>
        <li>HTML-CSS: The basics and essentials for a webpage.</li>
        <li>Javascript: To create an interactive page and easier to use filters, javascript is ideal.</li>
        <li>SCSS: Indeed, CSS is the basic, but sometime it can be rather repetitive or just tiresome, so we took
          advantage of a CSS-compiler to ease our work.</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
  </section>
  <section typeof="sa:HowToUse" id="howToUse" role="doc-howToUse">

    <section id="Scan">
      <h2>Scan</h2>
      <p>
        Scanning products in the scan page is really easy, clicking on the "Scan new product" button, and positioning
        the bar code in from of the laptop's webcam or phone' camera and making the photo.
      </p>
      <p>On the same page, it is possible to add the scanned products to the favorite lists, and to remove them from
        said list, all with the help of the "Add to/Remove from favorites"</p>

    <section id="Recommandations">

    <h2>Abstract</h2>
    <p>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      Gore, while seeming simple or even useless, can be a saviour in case you are at your wits ends while choosing
      what to eat, you got bored of your current product choices or your mother asked you what you want to eat and
      doesn't want you to be unimaginative.
    </p>
    <p>
      Just add to the filters what kind of product you wish to see and do not
      wish to see, or even scan products to add them as your favorite to make the search more efficient, and you may
      discover products you weren't aware of or even might get in the mood to eat something you haven't in a long time!
